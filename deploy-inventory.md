## Deploying the Inventory Service

As explained in the introduction we need an Inventory service as part of the Cool Store Portal architecture to provide the quantity (hence the availability too) of a given product by ID.

We're going to save time by deploying the 'inventory' service instead of coding it. But before we actually deploy the service we're going to explain briefly some concepts.

#### Technology

Our **'Inventory'** service has been implemented as a Java EE Microprofile application mainly using JAX-RS (REST) and JPA (persistency). Red Hat Openshift provides several runtimes to build services using Node.js, Java, C#, etc. Given that the service is implemented using Java EE Microprofile technology we're going to use  WildFly Swarm runtime. 

#### What is WildFly Swarm?

Java EE applications are traditionally created as an `ear` or `war` archive including all dependencies and deployed in an application server. Multiple Java EE applications can and were typically deployed in the same application server. This model is well understood in the development teams and has been used over the past several years.

WildFly Swarm offers an innovative approach to packaging and running Java EE applications by packaging them with just enough of the Java EE server runtime to be able to run them directly on the JVM using `java -jar`. For more details on various approaches to packaging Java 
applications, read [this blog post](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/08/24/the-skinny-on-fat-thin-hollow-and-uber).

WildFly Swarm is based on WildFly and it's compatible with MicroProfile, which is a community effort to standardize the subset of Java EE standards such as JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P that are useful for building microservices applications.

Since WildFly Swarm is based on Java EE standards, it significantly simplifies refactoring existing Java EE applications to microservices and allows much of the existing code-base to be reused in the new services.

#### WildFly Swarm Maven Project 

The `inventory-wildfly-swarm` project has the following structure which shows the components of the WildFly Swarm project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

![Inventory Project]({% image_path wfswarm-inventory-project.png %}){:width="340px"}

This is a minimal Java EE project with support for JAX-RS for building RESTful services and JPA for connecting to a database. [JAX-RS](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jaxrs.htm) is one of Java EE standards that uses Java annotations to simplify the development of RESTful web services. [Java Persistence API (JPA)](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/partpersist.htm) is another Java EE standard that provides Java developers with an object/relational mapping facility for managing relational data in Java applications.

#### Deploy Inventory Database
By default our 'Inventory' service will use PostgreSQL, so please run the following command to deploy an instance of PostgreSQL.

~~~shell
oc new-app postgresql-persistent \
    --param=DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=inventory-postgresql \
    --param=POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=inventory \
    --param=POSTGRESQL_USER=inventory \
    --param=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=inventory \
    --labels=app=inventory
~~~

#### Deploy Inventory on OpenShift

Now itâ€™s time to build and deploy our service on OpenShift. 

OpenShift [Source-to-Image (S2I)]({{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build) 
feature can be used to build a container image from a git repository. OpenShift S2I uses the [supported OpenJDK container image](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_java_s2i_for_openshift) to build the final container image of the 
Inventory service by building the WildFly Swam uber-jar from source code (build strategy **'Source'**), using Maven, to the OpenShift platform.

Next commands are going to deploy our Inventory service.

* **Name:** inventory
* **S2I runtime:** redhat-openjdk18-openshift
* **Image tag:** 1.4
* **Repository:** {{LABS_GIT_REPO}}
* **Context Directory:** inventory-wildfly-swarm

~~~shell
$ oc new-app redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.4~{{LABS_GIT_REPO}} \
        --context-dir=inventory-wildfly-swarm \
        --name=inventory

$ oc expose svc/inventory
~~~

Once this completes, your project should be up and running. You can see the exposed DNS url for the Inventory service in the OpenShift Web Console or using OpenShift CLI:

~~~shell
$ oc get routes inventory

NAME        HOST/PORT                                        PATH       SERVICES  PORT  TERMINATION
inventory   inventory-{{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}-{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}.roadshow.openshiftapps.com   inventory  8080            None
~~~

Copy the route url for the Inventory service and verify the API Gateway service works using `curl`:

> The route urls in your project would be different from the ones in this lab guide! Use the one from your project.

~~~shell
$ curl http://{{INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST}}/api/inventory/329299

{"itemId":"329299","quantity":35}
~~~

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
